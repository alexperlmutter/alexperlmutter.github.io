I am an accomplished epidemiologist, who specializes in the principled use and development of advanced causal inference methods for answering pharmacepideiological research questions in numerous therapeutic areas. I currently work at Amgen, a large biotech company, where I support the bone health franchise's generation of real-world evidence on the benefit:risk profile of bone products and related regulatory engagements. Prior to joining Amgen, I was an epidemiologist at Target RWE, where I generated real-world evidence studies in the dermatology and oncology therapeutic areas. I received an MPH and a PhD in Epidemiology from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health where I had formal training epidemiological methods with a primary focus on causal inference methods.
